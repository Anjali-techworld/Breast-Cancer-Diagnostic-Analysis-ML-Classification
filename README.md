# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Analysis-ML-Classification
Breast cancer is one of the most common and serious health concerns worldwide, affecting millions of women each year. Early prediction and diagnosis of breast cancer can be challenging due to the complexity of the disease and its varying forms. The Breast Cancer dataset, commonly used in machine learning applications, provides a valuable resource for developing predictive models. It contains data on various features derived from fine-needle aspirates of breast mass images, such as tumor size, shape, and texture. By leveraging this data, machine learning models can aid in the classification of tumors as benign or malignant, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans. The development of such models is vital for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, optimizing healthcare resources, and improving patient outcomes in the fight against breast cancer.
A classifier in machine learning is a type of algorithm used to categorize data into predefined classes or categories. It predicts the class or label for a given input based on the training data it has learned from. 
Popular Algorithms:
in this dataset there algorithoms are mainly used'

Decision Trees: Tree-like structure for decision making.
Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees for robust classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Separates classes using a hyperplane.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on proximity to nearest data points.
Naive Bayes: Probabilistic model based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.
 Gradient Boosting Classifier : It is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak learners (typically decision trees) sequentially, with each new tree trying to correct the errors of the previous ones..
In this analysis we can get best performance model is SVC based on their accuracy
Here, we create a bar plot based on the SVC model to visualize the structure and better understand these metric features.
